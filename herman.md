I'm Herman Bergwerf, the developer of MolView. I live in the Netherlands.
Currently I'm studying for a bachelor degree in Nanobiology. Programming is my
biggest hobby. I've got some years of experience with native high performance
programming, computer graphics, and web programming. Recently I also started
rowing.

I've created MolView because I wanted to build organic molecules in my browser
without having to suffer from archaic Java applets or extremely ugly looking
sites. I'm still improving MolView because there are a lot of possibilities
waiting to be explored.
I hope MolView can help you to understand the world of molecules better than you
did before!
