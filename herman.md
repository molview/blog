I'm Herman Bergwerf, the developer of MolView. I live in the Netherlands
and I'm a high school student now. Programming is my ultimate hobby. I've got
some years of experience with native high performance programming, computer graphics,
and web programming. I'm also a Linux geek and a pizza fan ;-)

I've created MolView because I wanted to build organic molecules in my browser
without having to suffer from archaic Java applets or extremely ugly looking
sites. I'm still improving MolView because the project is still exiting me.
I hope MolView can help you to understand the world of molecules more easily!
