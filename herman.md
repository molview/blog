I'm Herman Bergwerf, the developer of MolView. I live in the Netherlands
and I'm a high school student now. Programming is my ultimate hobby. I've got
some years of experience with native high performance programming, computer graphics,
and web programming. I'm also a Linux geek and a Pizza fan <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
